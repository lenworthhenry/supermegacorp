This repository is for the AWS Internal Hackathon demonstrations this week.  The code will be deployed on two EC2 machines created by ECS in their own VPC.  DynamoDB will be the db client used for data access.
This application consists of two components:  the server which is a NodeJS powered web service and the front end which is an Angular Client Side application that uses the service for all business logic and data needs.
